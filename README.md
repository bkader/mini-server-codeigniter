# Mini Server - CodeIgniter 3.0.6
I simply love building portable web application using portable web servers.
The best portable web server I could find is [Uniform Server](http://www.uniformserver.com/).

**Mini Server CodeIgniter** is a ready-to-use portable server that uses [*Uniform Mini Server v1.0.11*](https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniserver/files/MiniServer/PHP_MiniServer/) 
and [*CodeIgniter v3.0.6*](https://codeigniter.com/).

* Some [helpers](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/core/helpers) and [libraries](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/core/libraries) have been enhanced and others added.
* CodeIgniter HMVC Modules of [**Jens Segers**](http://www.jenssegers.be).
* [cache](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/cache), [logs](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/logs) and [modules](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/modules) folders have been moved out of [application](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-codeigniter/tree/master/root/app) folder.
* This repository uses the *Mini Server version*, which means there will be absolutely no **MySQL**.
